# Simulation of the board game "Mensch Ã„rgere Dich Nicht"

You can find the rules of the game for example [here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht#Anleitung).

There are different strategies to play the game. The goal of this project is, to simulate the game to find out the best strategy.
The games are simulated without visualization.


## Refactoring

This was an old project of mine, probably from around 2019. Nowadays although still far from writing clean code, 
I see that there was alot to improve.

Some examples:

1. Variable naming:
E.g. ich, ego (for player objects of player class), w  (for the number of the dice roll), a (for the number of attempt in a turn).
